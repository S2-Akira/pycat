PyCAT Ethical Hacking Tool
===========================

1. Setup & Requirements:
------------------------
- Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed.
- Install required libraries:
  pip install impacket rich

2. Running PyCAT Server:
------------------------
- Run the main PyCAT script:
  python pycat.py

- This starts the server listening on port 9001, waiting for client connections.

3. Connecting Clients:
----------------------
- Clients must run a Python client script that connects back to your server IP on port 9001.
- You can create your own client or request a sample client script.

4. Using the Main Menu:
----------------------
- After server starts, you'll see:

  1. List clients
  2. Select client and start shell
  3. Pentesting tools
  0. Exit

- Press the number of your choice and Enter.

5. Listing Clients:
-------------------
- Choose option 1 to see all connected clients (shown as IP:port).

6. Remote Shell:
----------------
- Choose option 2.
- Enter the client ID (IP:port) you want to control.
- You can now type commands to run on the client.
- Type 'exit' to quit the shell.

7. Pentesting Tools:
--------------------
- Choose option 3.
- Inside, choose:

  1. SMB Null Session Check
  0. Back to main menu

- SMB Null Session Check lets you test a target IP for SMB shares accessible without credentials.

8. Exiting:
-----------
- Choose option 0 at any menu to exit or go back.

9. Important Notes:
-------------------
- Only test systems you have permission to.
- SMB Null Session Check requires SMB port 445 open on the target.
- Clients must be running and connected for remote shell to work.

10. Sample Client:
------------------
- A minimal client script is included in the README or can be requested.
